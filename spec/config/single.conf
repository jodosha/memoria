# Redis configuration file example

# By default Redis does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
# Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid when daemonized.
daemonize yes

# When run as a daemon, Redis write a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid by default.
# You can specify a custom pid file location here.
pidfile ./tmp/redis-single.pid

# Accept connections on the specified port, default is 6379
port 6379

# If you want you can bind a single interface, if the bind option is not
# specified all the interfaces will listen for connections.
#
# bind 127.0.0.1

# Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds
timeout 5

# Save the DB on disk:
#
#   save <seconds> <changes>
#
#   Will save the DB if both the given number of seconds and the given
#   number of write operations against the DB occurred.
#
#   In the example below the behaviour will be to save:
#   after 900 sec (15 min) if at least 1 key changed
#   after 300 sec (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed
#   after 60 sec if at least 10000 keys changed
save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000

# For default save/load DB in/from the working directory
# Note that you must specify a directory not a file name.
dir ./tmp

# Set server verbosity to 'debug'
# it can be one of:
# debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
# notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
# warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)
loglevel debug

# Specify the log file name. Also 'stdout' can be used to force
# the demon to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
logfile stdout

# Set the number of databases.
databases 16

################################# REPLICATION #################################

# Master-Slave replication. Use slaveof to make a Redis instance a copy of
# another Redis server. Note that the configuration is local to the slave
# so for example it is possible to configure the slave to save the DB with a
# different interval, or to listen to another port, and so on.

# slaveof <masterip> <masterport>

################################## SECURITY ###################################

# Require clients to issue AUTH <PASSWORD> before processing any other
# commands.  This might be useful in environments in which you do not trust
# others with access to the host running redis-server.
#
# This should stay commented out for backward compatibility and because most
# people do not need auth (e.g. they run their own servers).

# requirepass foobared

############################### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############################

# Glue small output buffers together in order to send small replies in a
# single TCP packet. Uses a bit more CPU but most of the times it is a win
# in terms of number of queries per second. Use 'yes' if unsure.
glueoutputbuf yes

# Use object sharing. Can save a lot of memory if you have many common
# string in your dataset, but performs lookups against the shared objects
# pool so it uses more CPU and can be a bit slower. Usually it's a good
# idea.
shareobjects no
